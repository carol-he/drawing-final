My drawing on the web final project

For my final project, I want to make three drawings that either inspire or calm people down. They are all interpretations of instrumental music by one of my favorite artists, Petit Biscuit.

The navigation page is a page where it's snowing (I used [this library](http://www.schillmania.com/projects/snowstorm/)). On top of a snowy rock there's three gems, each of which lead to one of my pages. The color of the gem represents the dominant colors of the scene. Each of my pages also have a full moon and a crescent moon, which can each be used for navigation.

The first page allows the user to be in a space that is calming and beautiful. It's a song called 'sunset lover' so I thought a sunset would be appropriate. It has clouds moving and a gradient keyframes animation.

The second page is a page dedicated to solitude and stillness. I used clouds again but slowed down the speeds, because I didn't want it to seem like there was a lot of movement going on in the scene.

The third page is dedicated to feelings of inspiration and hope. I wanted to simulate northern lights on this page because they are so vibrant and beautiful. If I have time in the future, I want to learn how to animate SVGs because I feel like that would make it look even more realistic.
