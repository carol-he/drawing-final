My drawing on the web final project

For my final project, I want to make three drawings that inspire people during hard times, each in its own way depending on the mood of the user. Each room will be an interpretation of a song that has an underlying message.

The first page is the simplest, and allows the user to be in a space that is calming and beautiful. It’s supposed to show that despite the troubles they face, beautiful things continue to exist in life, such as sunsets and pretty songs.

The second room is for when the user can acknowledge their problems. It addresses doubt, fear, and insecurities. It’s supposed to remind people that though they may feel alone, everyone is subject to the human condition and being imperfect. Because of this, it is important to choose wisely with how you deal with pain.

The third room is about realizing that you have made progress in healing, and that it’s important to look towards the future. It’s about uplifting and being positive about the future although it is uncertain, and that it’s never too late to start taking control over your attitude on life and grow from old mistakes.

I intend to enhance my project by allowing the user to interact with objects in the space in order to play or pause music and animations in a way that uses something other than just the default music player. I also want to try creating a character in one of the drawings so that the user can move to interact with space.
